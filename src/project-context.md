### Key Relationships
- Projects â†’ Deployments (1:many)
- Changelog Entries â†’ Projects (many:1)
- Deployments â†’ Changelog (1:1 for deployment events)
- Real-time subscriptions for live updates

## GitHub Actions Workflows

### 1. Clean and Deploy to Stage (`.github/workflows/clean-and-deploy.yml`)
**Trigger**: Repository dispatch event
**Process**:
1. Checkout source repository
2. Install dependencies and clean cache
3. Run Lovable reference cleanup script
4. Create temporary cleaned source directory
5. Clone or initialize stage repository
6. Copy cleaned files using tar for reliability
7. Commit and push to stage repository
8. Update deployment status via Supabase Edge Function

**Key Fix**: Updated to use `PORTFOLIO_TOKEN` instead of `STAGE_TOKEN`

### 2. Build and Deploy to Production (`.github/workflows/build-and-deploy.yml`)
**Trigger**: Production deployment dispatch
**Process**:
1. Checkout stage repository
2. Install dependencies and build project
3. Clone or initialize production repository
4. Copy built files to production
5. Add GitHub Pages workflow if needed
6. Commit and push to production
7. Update deployment status
